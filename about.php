About Dr. Sachse<br/><br/><br/>Following residencies in General Surgery and Maxillofacial Surgery, Dr. Rainer E. Sachse obtained his plastic surgery training at the world-renowned Duke University Medical Center in Durham, NC. Following his residency, Dr. Sachse accepted an offer to stay on as a faculty member at Duke, where he remained for four years before moving to Fort Lauderdale, Florida.<br/> <br/>Dr. Sachse has a passion and is known for providing excellence in patient care. This seems to be the reason why he has been consistently voted as the best plastic surgeons in Eastern Broward County. He is an active member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, the Broward County Society of Plastic Surgeons, the Broward County Medical Association, the Florida Medical Association, and the American Society for Mohs Surgery (skin cancer treatment), among other organizations.<br/> <br/>Dr. Sachse believes that it is never too late to fix the little imperfections that have always bothered you as long as you are in a good overall medical condition. “I have patients who have had breast augmentation after the age of 60 who finally decided to fulfill a life-long dream.. Cosmetic surgery is a lifestyle decision, the implications of which are mainly an increase in self-esteem. Why not change your nose, freshen up those droopy eyelids, what's wrong with making ourselves look younger if we feel younger than we look?”<br/> <br/>Dr. Sachse is known as a perfectionist who follows the maxim to treat his patients as if they were family members. This is the reason why minimally invasive procedures are often favored, which have a much shorter recovery time and less post-operative discomfort. Questions and concerns about surgery are addressed honestly and openly, and the patient's privacy is always strictly guarded. In the post-operative period, Dr. Sachse remains available 24 hours a day, and follow-up care is performed following the highest medical standards. In view of this, Dr. Sachse and his team at Broward Plastic Surgery pride themselves in providing outstanding value for their patients. Dr. Sachse summarizes by stating: “We practice evidence based medicine and use the latest scientific information to guide our care and services. Within these considerations, the safety and comfort of our patients remains our highest priority.”<br/> <br/>Languages:<br/>English, French, German, and Spanish.<br/> <br/>Education:<br/>Full medical as well as full dental training (M.D. & D.D.S.) at Friedrich-Alexander-University in <br/>Erlangen, Germany<br/> <br/>Residency:<br/>Internships: Klinikum Nuernberg, Germany 1984-1985<br/>General Surgery: Jackson Memorial Hospital, Miami, FL 1986-1988<br/>Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery: University of Tuebingen 1988-1991<br/>Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery: Duke University Medical Center 1991-1994<br/> <br/>Degrees and Certifications:<br/>American Boards of Plastic Surgery<br/>German Boards of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery<br/>German Boards of Plastic Surgery<br/>American Boards of Laser Surgery<br/> <br/>Past Appointments and Faculty Member:<br/>Faculty, Duke University Medical Center, Division of Plastic, Reconstructive, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery 1994-1998<br/>Chief, Plastic Surgery, Durham Veterans Administration Medical Center 1994-1998<br/>Consulting Plastic Surgeon, Asheville and Fayetteville Veterans Administration Medical Center 1994-1998<br/>Vice Chairman, Dept. of Plastic Surgery, Klinikum Nuernberg, Germany 1998-1999<br/> <br/>Current Appointments:<br/>Consulting Assistant Professor, Dept. of Plastic Surgery, Duke University		<br/>Department Chief, Plastic Surgery, Holy Cross Hospital, Fort Lauderdale, FL<br/> <br/>Professional Memberships:<br/>American College of Surgeons – Fellow<br/>American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons<br/>American Society for Mohs Surgery<br/>Broward County Medical Association and former delegate to the FMA   <br/>Broward County Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons<br/>Florida Medical Association<br/> <br/>Hospital Privileges:<br/>Holy Cross Hospital, Imperial Point Medical Center, Surgery Center of Fort Lauderdale, Broward Health Medical Center, North Broward Medical Center			<br/> 		<br/>Publications and Lectures:<br/>Multiple, on national and international levels<br/><br/>Innovations:<br/>Dr. Sachse developed several novel surgical instruments, some of which have been patented and are in use worldwide.<br/>
