Procedures Offered<br/><br/>The most commonly requested procedures at Broward Plastic Surgery are Facial Rejuvenation, Body Contouring (especially tummy tucks), Breast Augmentation and Rejuvenation, and, because of Dr. Sachse's expertise in Mohs Micrographic Surgery and reconstruction of the face, the care of skin cancers.<br/> <br/>Typical procedures in rejuvenation of the face are: Lifting the wattles/throat and jowls with a lower face/neck lift; Raising the brow to open the upper face and eye area; Blepharoplasty to remove and tighten lax, excess skin from the upper lids and bags and fat deposits from the lower; Otoplasty for the correction of disproportionately large ears; Rhinoplasty to smooth and refine the minor (or major) errors of nature or misfortunes of untimely physical contact, and chin and cheek implants for that longed-for and dreamt-about extreme makeover.<br/> <br/>Body contouring procedures include: Abdominoplasty (tummy tucks) to eliminate the physical reminders of weight loss or past pregnancies; Breast Augmentation, Reduction, Lift (mastopexy) and Reconstruction for better esthetic balance; Brachioplasty (arm lift) to refine the upper arms; Liposuction, when you've met your weight loss goals but are stuck with a few stubborn lumps that mar your silhouette; and post bariatric surgery body lifts.<br/> <br/>Common smaller adjuvant procedures include Botox, facial, lip and tissue fillers like Restylane, Hylaform, Radiance, collagen injections, chemical peels, laser rejuvenation eradicating broken capillaries, the brown spots of sun and age, and laser hair removal. Whereas smaller procedures are usually performed in the office, larger operations are done in the area's major hospitals or Outpatient Surgical Centers to assure maximum patient safety.<br/> <br/>Sometimes, our need for a plastic surgeon is not elective. Skin cancers, especially of the face, are a frightening health challenge. Dr. Sachse's impeccable training as a Mohs Micrographic surgeon (a tissue sparing method of excising cutaneous cancers) combined with his expertise in manipulating skin tissue, places him in the company of a relative few surgeons. He has restored a normal appearance for many patients after excision of a serious, invasive skin cancer so they can face the world without embarrassment.<br/><br/><br/>Abdominoplasty<br/> <br/>Also known as a tummy tuck, removes excess fat and skin, and in most cases restores weakened or separated muscles creating an abdominal profile that is smoother and firmer.<br/>A flat and well-toned abdomen is something many of us strive for through exercise and weight control. Sometimes these methods cannot achieve our goals.<br/>Even individuals of otherwise normal body weight and proportion can develop an abdomen that protrudes or is loose and sagging. The most common causes of this include:<br/>Pregnancy<br/>Aging<br/>Significant fluctuations in weight<br/>Heredity<br/>Prior surgery<br/>Tummy tuck surgery is a highly individualized procedure and you should do it for yourself, not to fulfill someone else's desires or to try to fit any sort of ideal image.<br/>Abdominoplasty is a good option for you if:<br/>You are physically healthy and at a stable weight<br/>You have realistic expectations<br/>You do not smoke<br/>Although the results of an abdominoplasty procedure are technically permanent, the positive outcome can be greatly diminished by significant fluctuations in your weight. For this reason, individuals who are planning substantial weight loss or women who may be considering future pregnancies may be advised to postpone abdominoplasty surgery.<br/>What a tummy tuck won't do:<br/>Tummy tucks are not a substitute for weight loss or an appropriate exercise program. Also, tummy tuck operations cannot correct stretch marks, although these may be removed or somewhat improved if they are located on the areas of excess skin that will be excised, generally the treated areas below the belly button.<br/>
